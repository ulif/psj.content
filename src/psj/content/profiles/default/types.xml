 <!-- This file registers new types with portal_types. The types are
      then configured with the corresponding files in types/*.xml. Note
      that spaces are allowed in type names, but the corresponding XML file
      uses an underscore instead. The "Factory-based Type Information with
      dynamic views" refers to an FTI from Products.CMFDynamicViewFTI,
      which supports Plone's "display" menu.
